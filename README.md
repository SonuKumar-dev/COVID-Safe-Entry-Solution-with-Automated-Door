# COVID-Safe-Entry-Solution-with-Automated-Door-
Smart Door Opening System with temperature  and distance sensor

The project is designed for an automatic door-opening system using Distance and
Temperature Sensor. This project not only gets rid of the risk of allotting a person to check the temperatures of people entering the building but also creates a safe environment and reduces the risk of spreading of the covid -19
and is a step towards the normal situation. This is achieved with the help of Distance and
Temperature Sensor This sensing signal is fed to a microcontroller to operate a door motor through the motor driver IC. When a body approaches within the operating range of the sensor, it sends a logical command to open the door. The door automatically closes with a fixed time delay.
